# Tool Reference — 60 Tools

Every tool the server exposes, grouped by purpose. The AI agent picks tools automatically — the *example prompts* show what to ask to trigger them; you never name tools yourself.

> **C# bridge first:** on Windows D365FO VMs, 16 read tools query the live `IMetadataProvider` (always-fresh metadata) and `DYNAMICSXREFDB` (compiler-resolved cross-references), falling back to SQLite transparently on Azure/Linux. All write operations go exclusively through the bridge. See [BRIDGE.md](BRIDGE.md) and [SQLITE_DEPENDENCY.md](SQLITE_DEPENDENCY.md).
>
> **Server modes:** `full` = all 60 tools · `read-only` (Azure) = search/analysis only · `write-only` (hybrid companion) = file operations + bridge-backed reads. See [MCP_CONFIG.md](MCP_CONFIG.md).

## Recommended workflows

The grounding chain is what makes generated code compile on the first try:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Extend["Extending existing code"]
        A1[prepare_change] --> A2[generate code]
        A2 --> A3[resolve_references<br/>+ validate_xpp]
        A3 --> A4[modify_d365fo_file]
    end
    subgraph Create["New objects"]
        B1[prepare_create] --> B2[generate code]
        B2 --> B3[resolve_references<br/>+ validate_xpp]
        B3 --> B4[create_d365fo_file]
    end
    subgraph Forms["New forms"]

        C2 --> C3["generate_smart_form<br/>(cloneFrom)"]
        C3 --> C4[validate_form_pattern]
        C4 --> C5[create_d365fo_file]
    end
```

| Workflow | Chain | Gate |
|----------|-------|------|
| CoC / event handler / extension | `prepare_change` → generate → `resolve_references` + `validate_xpp` → `modify_d365fo_file` | grounding token + reference proof |
| New class / table / enum | `prepare_create` → generate → `resolve_references` + `validate_xpp` → `create_d365fo_file` | grounding token + collision check |
| New form | `get_form_patterns(recommend)` → `get_form_pattern_spec` → `generate_smart_form(cloneFrom)` → `validate_form_pattern` → `create_d365fo_file` | structural pattern gate (FP001–FP010) |

## ✅ Quality & Grounding (6)

| Tool | What it does | When it runs |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| `prepare_change` | One call before extending: signature + existing CoC wrappers + eligibility + strategy + **grounding token** | automatically, before modifications |
| `prepare_create` | One call before creating: collision check + naming + EDT/label suggestions + property defaults + **grounding token** | automatically, before new objects |
| `resolve_references` | Proves every type/field/method/label in generated code against the index — anti-hallucination gate | automatically, after generation |
| `validate_xpp` | Offline BP validator, < 50 ms: deprecated APIs, CoC correctness, select anti-patterns, data-driven XML property rules mined from standard models | automatically, after generation |
| `validate_form_pattern` | See [Form Patterns](#-form-patterns-3) | before form writes |
| `review_workspace_changes` | AI code review of uncommitted X++ changes (git diff) | on request: *"Review my changes"* |
> **Grounding enforcement:** `prepare_change` issues a SHA-256 provenance token (30-min TTL) **bound to the object it was issued for**. When `GROUNDING_ENFORCE=true` is set in `.env`:
> - extension patterns in `generate_code` and extension objectTypes in `create_d365fo_file` / `modify_d365fo_file` require a valid token for the target object, and
> - X++ source passed to `create_d365fo_file` / `modify_d365fo_file` is run through `resolve_references` — the write is rejected while any identifier cannot be proven against the index.
>
> This ensures generated code is grounded in your actual codebase, not AI training data.
>
> **Hybrid deployment note:** grounding tokens live in the issuing process's memory. In `write-only` mode (local companion) `prepare_change` is not exposed and tokens issued by the read-only/Azure instance cannot be validated locally, so `GROUNDING_ENFORCE=true` is **ignored** there (with a startup warning) — otherwise the agent would loop forever between the two servers. Only enable enforcement on a `full`-mode server.

## Tips
- **Describe goals, not tools.** The instruction files route requests automatically — *"add a priority field to CustTable and show it on the form"* triggers the whole chain.
- **Let the gates work.** `GROUNDING_ENFORCE` and `FORM_PATTERN_ENFORCE` (both default on) reject ungrounded or structurally invalid writes — that's the feature, not friction.
- **Verify after writing.** `verify_d365fo_project` confirms disk + project registration in one call.
- **Full conversations:** [USAGE_EXAMPLES.md](USAGE_EXAMPLES.md) shows seven real multi-tool scenarios end to end.
